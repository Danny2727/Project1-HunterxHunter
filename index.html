            <p>Hunter x Hunter", is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi with two anime
                adaptations. The first chapter of the Hunter x Hunter manga series was published in March 1998, in
                Weekly Shōnen Jump.

                The story of Hunter x Hunter focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the
                father he has always been told was dead is alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging Freecss, is a
                legendary Hunter. Despite the fact that his father abandoned Gon with his relatives in order to pursue
                his dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow his father's footsteps, pass the Hunter Exam, and
                eventually find his father to prove himself as a Hunter in his own right.</p>

                A Hunter's job is not only that of looking for treasures and hunting animals. True Hunters dedicate
                themselves to the protection of knowledge, people, and nature. They must preserve culturally precious
                items or species of animals and plants they are able to discover. Furthermore, they must also arrest
                criminals and in rare cases even fellow Hunters who have committed heinous crimes. A "hunt"
                can range from a task commissioned by a client to one ordered by the higher-ups of the
                organization, to a quest a Hunter goes on of their own volition.

            <p>Nen is one of the defining features of the Hunter × Hunter manga by Yoshihiro Togashi. It's a technique
                that allows a living being to use
                and manipulate their own life energy (known as aura), the term "Nen" can also be used in conversation
                to refer to aura. A person capable of utilizing Nen is colloquially referred to as a "Nen user", while
                those who cannot go by the designation "non-users"
                Because one can craft a great variety of parapsychological abilities through Nen, it is considered a
                dangerous power that is kept hidden from the public at large to maintain balance in society.</p>

                Nen is a power unknown to the public at large, with only a minority of persons being capable of using it
                or even being privy to its existence. Reports of incidents involving Nen are often misleading, in
                large part because ignorance of its existence necessarily leads to incorrect assumptions.

                Some non-users who hear of Nen believe it to be no more than a mental technique to gain a small boost in
                physical abilities by accessing the dormant power in one's body. For their part, Nen users tend to
                avoid attracting too much attention in order to prevent society from spiraling into chaos.
