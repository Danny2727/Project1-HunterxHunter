            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Hunter Association is a non-governmental organization responsible for the testing and licensing of
                "Hunters", individuals who have
                proven themselves through the rigorous exam to be elite members of humanity. With the passing of the
                Hunter
                Exam, an applicant is rewarded with a license to go almost anywhere in the world and do almost anything,
                thus declaring them Hunters. Typically, Hunters devote themselves to tracking down priceless items,
                mystical
                places, and the unseen wonders of the world.</p>

        <h3>Becoming a Hunter</h3>
        <p>To become a Professional Hunter, two requirements have to be fulfilled: passing the Hunter Exam as well as
            the Secret Hunter Exam. It has been implied that the rules do not bar non-human candidates (presumably
            beings with a comparable level of intelligence) from taking the Hunter Exam, and thus from becoming
            Hunters.</p>
